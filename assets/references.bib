abstract = {This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality rates, costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report examines how the use of biomarkers may influence the AD diagnostic process and estimates of prevalence and incidence of the disease. An estimated 5.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's dementia. By mid-century, the number of people living with Alzheimer's dementia in the United States is projected to grow to 13.8 million, fueled in large part by the aging baby boom generation. Today, someone in the country develops Alzheimer's dementia every 66 seconds. By 2050, one new case of Alzheimer's dementia is expected to develop every 33 seconds, resulting in nearly 1 million new cases per year. In 2014, official death certificates recorded 93,541 deaths from AD, making AD the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age ≥65 years. Between 2000 and 2014, deaths resulting from stroke, heart disease, and prostate cancer decreased 21{\%}, 14{\%}, and 9{\%}, respectively, whereas deaths from AD increased 89{\%}. The actual number of deaths to which AD contributes is likely much larger than the number of deaths from AD recorded on death certificates. In 2017, an estimated 700,000 Americans age ≥65 years will have AD when they die, and many of them will die because of the complications caused by AD. In 2016, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.2 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. This care is valued at more than {\$}230 billion. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age ≥65 years with Alzheimer's or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2017 for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people age ≥65 years with dementia are estimated to be {\$}259 billion. In recent years, efforts to develop and validate AD biomarkers, including those detectable with brain imaging and in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, have intensified. Such efforts could transform the practice of diagnosing AD from one that focuses on cognitive and functional symptoms to one that incorporates biomarkers. This new approach could promote diagnosis at an earlier stage of disease and lead to a more accurate understanding of AD prevalence and incidence.},

abstract = {A common feature of ambient intelligence is that many objects are inter-connected and act in unison, which is also a challenge in the Internet of Things. There has been a shift in research towards integrating both concepts, considering the Internet of Things as representing the future of computing and communications. However, the efficient combination and management of heterogeneous things or devices in the ambient intelligence domain is still a tedious task, and it presents crucial challenges. Therefore, to appropriately manage the inter-connection of diverse devices in these systems requires: (1) specifying and efficiently implementing the devices (e.g., as services); (2) handling and verifying their heterogeneity and composition; and (3) standardizing and managing their data, so as to tackle large numbers of systems together, avoiding standalone applications on local servers. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a platform to manage the integration and behavior-aware orchestration of heterogeneous devices as services, stored and accessed via the cloud, with the following contributions: (i) we describe a lightweight model to specify the behavior of devices, to determine the order of the sequence of exchanged messages during the composition of devices; (ii) we define a common architecture using a service-oriented standard environment, to integrate heterogeneous devices by means of their interfaces, via a gateway, and to orchestrate them according to their behavior; (iii) we design a framework based on cloud computing technology, connecting the gateway in charge of acquiring the data from the devices with a cloud platform, to remotely access and monitor the data at run-time and react to emergency situations; and (iv) we implement and generate a novel cloud-based IoT platform of behavior-aware devices as services for ambient intelligence systems, validating the whole approach in real scenarios related to a specific ambient assisted living application.},

abstract = {The {\&}{\#}x201D;Internet of Things{\&}{\#}x201D; has led to a number of standardization efforts that can make proprietary protocols for home automation obsolete. One of the latest developments is the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) that is intended to be used as the HTTP-replacement for smart objects that are connected to the Internet. Early adaptors in industry and academia already have developed a plethora of applications that build on this new standard and have contributed valuable insights and implementation experience. While most of the new applications interoperate in a reasonable manner, the integration of legacy is one of the biggest challenges. Many existing protocols for home automation have been designed with a narrow focus on very limited devices that communicate with each other in a local network. CoAP, in contrast, mimics the architectural style that represents the fundamental basis of the Web, and therefore follows a very different design approach. In this paper, we present a basic design concept to interconnect CoAP and the proprietary FS20 protocol for home automation. The key aspects of our approach are the mapping of FS20 device addresses to path segments of CoAP URIs and to map FS20 commands to the four basic CoAP operations for creation, retrieval, update and deletion of resources, and the dynamic discovery of new nodes to register their capabilities with the CoAP service. To prove the feasibility of this approach, we have developed a multi-protocol gateway for a popular low-budget integrated access device.},

abstract = {The proportion of successful hits, usually referred to as "accuracy", is by far the most dominant meter for measuring classifiers' accuracy. This is despite of the fact that accuracy does not compensate for hits that can be attributed to mere chance. Is it a meaningful flaw in the context of machine learning? Are we using the wrong meter for decades? The results of this study do suggest that the answers to these questions are positive. Cohen's kappa, a meter that does compensate for random hits, was compared with accuracy, using a benchmark of fifteen datasets and five well-known classifiers. It turned out that the average probability of a hit being the result of mere chance exceeded one third (!). It was also found that the proportion of random hits varied with different classifiers that were applied even to a single dataset. Consequently, the rankings of classifiers' accuracy, with and without compensation for random hits, differed from each other in eight out of the fifteen datasets. Therefore, accuracy may well fail in its main task, namely to properly measure the accuracy-wise merits of the classifiers themselves. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In low-power wireless systems, power-efficiency is determined by the ability to maintain a low radio duty cycle: keeping the radio off as much as possible. We present an implementation of the IETF Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for the Contiki operating system that leverages the ContikiMAC low-power duty cycling mechanism to provide power efficiency. We experimentally evaluate our low-power CoAP, demonstrating that an existing application layer protocol can be made power-efficient through a generic radio duty cycling mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, our CoAP implementation is the first to provide power-efficient operation through radio duty cycling. Our results question the need for specialized low-power mechanisms at the application layer, instead providing low-power operation only at the radio duty cycling layer.},

The model also supports inferences about the evolution of plan execution in situations where another agent intervenes in plan execution.

abstract = {Recent research on academic writing has established the intersection of writing and identity. However, it is not clear whether writers themselves are aware of this link. In this study, we investigated five ESL graduate students' awareness of the identities that they constructed through the appropriation of others' words and ideas in their texts. Moving beyond prevalent moral explanations, we further sought alternative reasons for students' inappropriate textual borrowing practices, often categorized as plagiarism. Our findings suggest that, depending on their enculturation into disciplinary discourses, students exhibit different levels of awareness of the available and privileged identity options in the social contexts of writing. We argue that student textual plagiarism can best be viewed as an issue of authorial identity construction. The findings indicate that the roots of students' production of institutionally unacceptable texts lie in their epistemological orientation as well as their authoritative view of source texts. We finally reflect on the implications of the findings for academic writing instruction. Drawing on the notion of students-as-ethnographers, we suggest that writing instruction can raise students' awareness of the link between writing and self-representation as well as the epistemology underpinning academic authorship, as two important dimensions of successful writing.},

The addition of expert knowledge substitutes the need for supervised learning techniques, rendering the system easy to interpret and easy to improve incrementally. The proposed method is compared to an approach based on peak detection.

In our previous work, a mobile gait-monitoring system was developed, which provided visual feedback based on GRFs measured by a Smart Shoe (used as a mobile platform). However, the limited information provided by the Smart Shoe alone may not be adequate for a tele-monitoring system using the Internet. In the present tele-monitoring system for gait rehabilitation, a Smart Shoe is combined with an IMU for detailed monitoring of walking motions. By analyzing the signals from the IMU and the Smart Shoe, foot trajectories, walking distance, length of stride, etc., can be estimated. A user-friendly graphic interface displays the measured or estimated data on separate computers at the patient's location and the physical therapist's office.

abstract = {Automatic classification of everyday activities can be used for promotion of health-enhancing physical activities and a healthier lifestyle. In this paper, methods used for classification of everyday activities like walking, running, and cycling are described. The aim of the study was to find out how to recognize activities, which sensors are useful and what kind of signal processing and classification is required. A large and realistic data library of sensor data was collected. Sixteen test persons took part in the data collection, resulting in approximately 31 h of annotated, 35-channel data recorded in an everyday environment. The test persons carried a set of wearable sensors while performing several activities during the 2-h measurement session. Classification results of three classifiers are shown: custom decision tree, automatically generated decision tree, and artificial neural network. The classification accuracies using leave-one-subject-out cross validation range from 58 to 97{\%} for custom decision tree classifier, from 56 to 97{\%} for automatically generated decision tree, and from 22 to 96{\%} for artificial neural network. Total classification accuracy is 82 {\%} for custom decision tree classifier, 86{\%} for automatically generated decision tree, and 82{\%} for artificial neural network.},

abstract = {A home monitoring system uses ambient sensors to observe the daily activities of multiple inhabitants, and provides tools to analyze short-and long-term behavior patterns. Activity recognition and monitoring play important roles in smart home systems, which rely on perceiving and understand-ing inhabitants' behavior to generate a response. Applications that require such pattern recognition include alarms to detect anomalies and personalized home automation systems (where automatic lighting, heating, or security are tailored to the habits of the inhabitants). To observe activity in an environment by the least intrusive means, we considered the use of ambient sensors, rather than cameras or wearables. Most existing work in this area focuses on environments with single inhabitants, 1 or on laboratories or tem-porarily occupied spaces, 2 and is conducted using high-density motion sensors. 3 We aim to provide a solution that includes tools for tracking, recognizing, and monitoring the day-to-day activities of inhabitant(s), but which is also suitable for real-life settings, under a strict policy that we discuss and agree with the inhabitants. Our testbed was a 260m 2 home in Carinthia, Austria, based on a framework similar to that of the Casa Vecchia project. 4 A family of four inhabited the house: parents, aged 46 and 45, and two children, aged 10 and 13, and there were also regu-lar visitors. Around the house we installed passive IR motion sensors, magnetic contacts for doors and cupboards, in-between switches, and window blind actuators (see Figure 1). All the devices (except the blind actuators) generated binary values (on/off, open/closed) when triggered by their interactions with the inhabitants. For privacy reasons, we were unable to use video cameras for observation, and for comfort and practicality we selected not to use identification devices (radio-frequency identification bracelets, for example). Therefore, to recognize and track movement by each person as they move around the space, we Figure 1. Left: Floor plan of the testbed house and sensor placements for the ambient sensor network. Right: Examples of the sensors: a motion sensor on the wall (top), a magnetic contact on a shower door (center), and an in-between switch for the TV (bottom). plan to extend an existing graph-based tracking method 2 by incorporating individual walking speed and daily movement patterns. We would then implement different graphical proba-bilistic models to recognize activities, such as coupled or parallel hidden Markov models (stochastic models where the system is assumed to have unobserved states) and conditional random fields (statistical modeling for identifying patterns). In a multi-inhabitant setting, people perform their activities either individually in parallel with each other, or jointly as a group. Most previous studies have involved two inhabitants, 5–7 but we plan to analyze the accuracy and complexity of the models when applied to a greater number of inhabitants. Providing the ground truth for the sensor data (i.e., the con-text in which the data was collected at the site) is an important step for evaluating our developed tools and algorithms.

AAL systems provide health monitoring through sensor based technologies to preserve health and functional ability and facilitate social support for the ageing population. Human activity recognition (HAR) is an enabler for the development of robust AAL solutions, especially in safety critical environments. Therefore, HAR models applied within this domain (e.g. for fall detection or for providing contextual information to caregivers) need to be accurate to assist in developing reliable support systems. In this paper, we evaluate three machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), a hybrid of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and SVM (SVM-HMM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) applied on a dataset collected between the elderly and their caregiver counterparts. Detected activities will later serve as inputs to a bidirectional activity awareness system for increasing social connectedness. Results show high classification performances for all three algorithms. Specifically, the SVM-HMM hybrid demonstrates the best classification performance. In addition to this, we make our dataset publicly available for use by the machine learning community.},

abstract = {In this work, algorithms are developed and evaluated to detect physical activities from data acquired using five small biaxial accelerometers worn simultaneously on different parts of the body. Acceleration data was collected from 20 subjects without researcher supervision or observation. Subjects were asked to perform a sequence of everyday tasks but not told specifically where or how to do them. Mean, energy, frequency-domain entropy, and correlation of acceleration data was calculated and several classifiers using these features were tested. Decision tree classifiers showed the best performance recognizing everyday activities with an overall accuracy rate of 84{\%}. The results show that although some activities are recognized well with subject-independent training data, others appear to require subject-specific training data. The results suggest that multiple accelerometers aid in recognition because conjunctions in acceleration feature values can effectively discriminate many activities. With just two biaxial accelerometers – thigh and wrist – the recognition performance dropped only slightly. This is the first work to investigate performance of recognition algorithms with multiple, wire-free accelerometers on 20 activities using datasets annotated by the subjects themselves.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Large physical activity surveillance projects such as the UK Biobank and NHANES are using wrist-worn accelerometer-based activity monitors that collect raw data. The goal is to increase wear time by asking subjects to wear the monitors on the wrist instead of the hip, and then to use information in the raw signal to improve activity type and intensity estimation. The purposes of this work was to obtain an algorithm to process wrist and ankle raw data and to classify behavior into four broad activity classes: ambulation, cycling, sedentary, and other activities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Participants (N = 33) wearing accelerometers on the wrist and ankle performed 26 daily activities. The accelerometer data were collected, cleaned, and preprocessed to extract features that characterize 2-, 4-, and 12.8-s data windows. Feature vectors encoding information about frequency and intensity of motion extracted from analysis of the raw signal were used with a support vector machine classifier to identify a subject's activity. Results were compared with categories classified by a human observer. Algorithms were validated using a leave-one-subject-out strategy. The computational complexity of each processing step was also evaluated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: With 12.8-s windows, the proposed strategy showed high classification accuracies for ankle data (95.0{\%}) that decreased to 84.7{\%} for wrist data. Shorter (4 s) windows only minimally decreased performances of the algorithm on the wrist to 84.2{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A classification algorithm using 13 features shows good classification into the four classes given the complexity of the activities in the original data set. The algorithm is computationally efficient and could be implemented in real time on mobile devices with only 4-s latency.},

Nevertheless, this hardware proves to be very expensive and not necessarily accessible to all. Moreover, most applications resulting from the use of these smart devices simply refer to energy saving and costs reducing of energy consumption. Thus, this paper proposes a new algorithmic method for an application field that is still very lightly exploited, i.e. the activity recognition of reduced-autonomy residents living in a smart habitat through load signatures. This one is based on steady-state operations and signatures and its extraction process of load signatures of appliances is carried out in a three-dimensional space through a single power analyzer which is non-intrusive (NIALM). This approach has been tested and verified rigorously through daily scenarios reproduced in the smart home prototype in a laboratory. Hence, we can affirm that, with an exceptionally minimal investment and the exploitation of especially limited data, our method can recognize the use of appliances with high precision and low-cost allowing us to compete with other approaches which are much more expensive and require supplementary equipment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown.

Low-power and low-cost devices are expected to create a network of interconnected smart objects able to transform our homes into real Smart Homes. However, the heterogeneity of the underlying technologies prevents these smart objects to natively interoperate for adapting the environment to users' needs. In addition, common users are often excluded from the development of new applicative services that exploit physical devices, as they do not have sufficient programming and technological skills. To overcome these limitations, we propose a software ecosystem that allows different-skilled users to develop location-aware services able to autonomously manage the Smart Home. These services control the environment in accordance with user-defined rules and the users' location, calculated by exploiting an indoor localization mechanism. In addition, to directly interact with smart devices, users can also define customized interfaces for mobile devices. Finally, a multi-protocol middleware allows both the services and the mobile applications to access the physical network hiding the underlying heterogeneities. As a proof-of-concept, the first implementation steps are presented.},

abstract = {Development of denoising algorithm for 3D acceleration signals is essential to facilitate accurate assessment of human movement in body sensor networks (BSN). In this study, firstly 3D acceleration signals were captured by self-developed nine-axis wireless BSN platform during 12 subjects performing regular walking. Then, acceleration noise was filtered using four common filters respectively: median filter, Butterworth low-pass filter, discrete wavelet package shrinkage and Kalman filter. Finally, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and correlation coefficient(R) between filtered signal and reference signal were determined. We found that (1) Kalman filter showed the largest SNR and R values, followed by median filter, discrete wavelet package shrinkage and finally Butterworth low-pass filter; whereas, after correcting waveform delay for Butterworth low-pass filter, its performance was a little better than that of Kalman filter; (2) Real-time performance of median filter related to its window length; Decomposition level influenced real-time performance of discrete wavelet package shrinkage; Butterworth low-pass filter could bring large waveform delay if filter order and cut-off frequency were not properly selected. The algorithms of these filters would be further investigated to achieve best noise reduction of 3D acceleration signals in future.},

In wearable computing scenarios, activities such as walking, standing and sitting can be inferred from data provided by body-worn acceleration sensors. In such settings, most approaches use a single set of features, regardless of which activity to be recognized. In this paper we show that recognition rates can be improved by careful selection of individual features for each activity. We present a systematic analysis of features computed from a real-world data set and show how the choice of feature and the window length over which the feature is computed affects the recognition rates for different activities. Finally, we give a recommendation of suitable features and window lengths for a set of common activities},

With increasing awareness about the energy crisis, the development of intelligent energy-saving systems has become a new trend in all circles. This work proposes an appliance-aware activity recognition mechanism for an IoT energy management system, and especially an intermediate management service layer for the conformability of current household appliances, which not only establishes communication services among various appliances, but also provides services for upper-layer application based on a service-oriented architecture. Further, the presented system has the capability to deduce human activities from appliances being used and the variation of their states, and provide energy management services. In other words, the system can identify home activities at present, and notify users what unused appliance is or turn them off automatically. According to experiment results, improving the usage behaviour of appliances by means of a remainder system improves the efficiency in saving household electricity.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},

METHODS: We have designed algorithms that automatically learn Markov models for each class of activity. These models are used to recognize activities that are performed in a smart home and to identify errors and inconsistencies in the performed activity. RESULTS: We validate our approach using data collected from 60 volunteers who performed a series of activities in our smart apartment testbed. The results indicate that the algorithms correctly label the activities and successfully assess the completeness and consistency of the performed task. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that activity recognition and assessment can be automated using machine learning algorithms and smart home technology. These algorithms will be useful for automating remote health monitoring and interventions.},

abstract = {Recent work in supervised learning has shown that a surprisingly simple Bayesian classifier with strong assumptions of independence among features, called naive Bayes, is competitive with state-of-the-art classifiers such as C4.5. This fact raises the question of whether a classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better. In this paper we evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on the theory of learning Bayesian networks. These networks are factored representations of probability distributions that generalize the naive Bayesian classifier and explicitly represent statements about independence. Among these approaches we single out a method we call Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), which outperforms naive Bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness that characterize naive Bayes. We experimentally tested these approaches, using problems from the University of California at Irvine repository, and compared them to C4.5, naive Bayes, and wrapper methods for feature selection.},

We extract discriminative informational features from smartphone accelerometers using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Despite the poor quality of their accelerometers, smartphones were used as capture devices due to their prevalence in today's society. Successful classification on this basis potentially makes the technology accessible to both elite and non-elite athletes. Extracted features are used to train different categories of classifiers. No one classifier family has a reportable direct advantage in activity classification problems to date; thus we examine classifiers from each of the most widely used classifier families. We investigate three classification approaches; a commonly used SVM-based approach, an optimized classification model and a fusion of classifiers. We also investigate the effect of changing several of the DWT input parameters, including mother wavelets, window lengths and DWT decomposition levels. During the course of this work we created a challenging sports activity analysis dataset, comprised of soccer and field-hockey activities. The average maximum F-measure accuracy of 87{\%} was achieved using a fusion of classifiers, which was 6{\%} better than a single classifier model and 23{\%} better than a standard SVM approach.},

A triaxial accelerometer was fixed to the subject's waist and the three acceleration signals were recorded by a portable data logger at a sampling rate of 256 Hz. Twenty healthy male subjects were asked to walk through a corridor and up and down a stairway as a single sequence, without any instruction. The data were analyzed using discrete wavelet transform. Walking patterns were classified in two stages. In the first stage, the times when the walking pattern changed were detected using the low-frequency component of the anteroposterior acceleration (LFA) and of the vertical acceleration (LFV). In the second stage, the three types of walking patterns were classified by comparing powers of wavelet coefficients in the vertical direction (PWCV) and in the anteroposterior direction (RPWCA). Changes in walking patterns could be detected by using either LFA or LFV. Walking down stairs could be distinguished from the other types of walking as it gave the largest value in PWCV, and walking up stairs could be discriminated from level walking using RPWCA. Level and stairway walking could be classified from continuous records of waist acceleration.},

In this problem, extracting effec-tive features for identifying activities is a critical but challenging task. Most existing work relies on heuristic hand-crafted feature design and shallow feature learning architectures, which cannot find those distinguishing features to accurately classify different activities. In this paper, we propose a sys-tematic feature learning method for HAR problem. This method adopts a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automate feature learning from the raw inputs in a systematic way. Through the deep architecture, the learned features are deemed as the higher level abstract representation of low level raw time series signals. By leveraging the labelled information via supervised learning, the learned features are endowed with more discrimi-native power. Unified in one model, feature learn-ing and classification are mutually enhanced. All these unique advantages of the CNN make it out-perform other HAR algorithms, as verified in the experiments on the Opportunity Activity Recogni-tion Challenge and other benchmark datasets.},

Conventional pattern recognition approaches have made tremendous progress in the past years. However, those methods often heavily rely on heuristic hand-crafted feature extraction, which could hinder their generalization performance. Additionally, existing methods are undermined for unsupervised and incremental learning tasks. Recently, the recent advancement of deep learning makes it possible to perform automatic high-level feature extraction thus achieves promising performance in many areas. Since then, deep learning based methods have been widely adopted for the sensor-based activity recognition tasks.

abstract = {Quantitative measurement of hand kinematics can help us to better understand pathophysiological aspects of finger neural control and quantify hand impairments. A sensor glove was developed based on resistive bend sensors and resistive force sensors to monitor finger joint angles and forces exerted to objects by fingers. The validity and reliability of the glove were evaluated. A novel method was proposed to visualize and quantify the abnormality of the inter-joint coordination. The validity test indicated that the accuracy error of measuring joint angles was approximately ±6° and that of measuring forces was approximately ±8 g. The reliability test yielded an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.9876 ± 0.0058 for the force sensors and 0.9561 ± 0.0431 for the bend sensors. The stability, accuracy and reliability of measuring joint angles were comparable with previous studies. The involvement of force sensors and the capacity of reflecting inter-joint coordination make the glove more comprehensive for hand function assessment.},

abstract = {We present an automated segmentation method based on the analysis of plantar pressure signals recorded from two synchronized wireless foot insoles. Given the strict limits on computational power and power consumption typical of wearable electronic components, our aim is to investigate the capability of a Hidden Markov Model machine-learning method, to detect gait phases with different levels of complexity in the processing of the wearable pressure sensors signals. Therefore three different datasets are developed: raw voltage values, calibrated sensor signals and a calibrated estimation of total ground reaction force and position of the plantar center of pressure. The method is tested on a pool of 5 healthy subjects, through a leave-one-out cross validation. The results show high classification performances achieved using estimated biomechanical variables, being on average the 96{\%}. Calibrated signals and raw voltage values show higher delays and dispersions in phase transition detection, suggesting a lower reliability for online applications.},

abstract = {Physical activity has a positive impact on people's well-being and it had been shown to decrease the occurrence of chronic diseases in the older adult population. To date, a substantial amount of research studies exist, which focus on activity recognition using inertial sensors. Many of these studies adopt a single sensor approach and focus on proposing novel features combined with complex classifiers to improve the overall recognition accuracy. In addition, the implementation of the advanced feature extraction algorithms and the complex classifiers exceed the computing ability of most current wearable sensor platforms. This paper proposes a method to adopt multiple sensors on distributed body locations to overcome this problem. The objective of the proposed system is to achieve higher recognition accuracy with “light-weight” signal processing algorithms, which run on a distributed computing based sensor system comprised of computationally efficient nodes. For analysing and evaluating the multi-sensor system, eight subjects were recruited to perform eight normal scripted activities in different life scenarios, each repeated three times. Thus a total of 192 activities were recorded resulting in 864 separate annotated activity states. The methods for designing such a multi-sensor system required consideration of the following: signal pre-processing algorithms, sampling rate, feature selection and classifier selection. Each has been investigated and the most appropriate approach is selected to achieve a trade-off between recognition accuracy and computing execution time. A comparison of six different systems, which employ single or multiple sensors, is presented. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed multi-sensor system can achieve an overall recognition accuracy of 96.4{\%} by adopting the mean and variance features, using the Decision Tree classifier. The results demonstrate that elaborate classifiers and feature sets are not required to achieve high recognition accuracies on a multi-sensor system.},

abstract = {The number of seniors and other people needing daily assistance continues to increase, but the current human resources available to achieve this in the coming years will certainly be insufficient. To remedy this situation, smart habitats have emerged as an innovative avenue for supporting needs of daily assistance. Smart homes aim to provide cognitive assistance in decision making by giving hints, suggestions, and reminders, with different kinds of effectors, to residents. To implement such technology, the first challenge to overcome is the recognition of ongoing activity. Some researchers have proposed solutions based on binary sensors or cameras, but these types of approaches infringed on residents' privacy. A new affordable activity-recognition system based on passive RFID technology can detect errors related to cognitive impairment. The entire system relies on an innovative model of elliptical trilateration with several filters, as well as on an ingenious representation of activities with spatial zones. The authors have deployed the system in a real smart-home prototype; this article renders the results of a complete set of experiments conducted on this new activity-recognition system with real scenarios.},

However, the data distribution of accelerometer is heavily affected by varying device locations and orientations, which will degrade the performance of recognition model. To solve this problem, we propose a fast, robust and device displacement free activity recognition model in this paper, which integrates principal component analysis (PCA) and extreme learning machine (ELM) to realize location-adaptive activity recognition. On the one hand, PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of feature space and extract robust features for recognition. On the other hand, in the online phase ELM is applied to classify the activity and adapt the recognition model to new device locations based on high confident recognition results in real time. Experimental results show that, with robust features and fast adaptation capability, the proposed model can adapt the classifier to new device locations quickly and obtain good recognition performance.},

The paper presents a method of fall detection on a wearable device and update update the intended recipient of the status of the subject wearing the fall detection device. The wearable device performs the majority of signal processing of the fall detection using embedded technology. It also sends notification to the intended recipient. The wearable device transmits the data in a ZigBee Network by using an XBee RF transceiver installed in the device. Another device utilized ESP8266 in this study acts as a gateway between IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) and 802.11 (Internet Protocol) to relay the data to the internet. With this, the intended recipient can receive the update using an Android Mobile Application that acquires the data from the internet. Through multiple testing and experiment, the researchers obtained a fall threshold of 9g, which means that a fall alert will be triggered whenever the ADXL345 digital accelerometer reads a value greater than 9g. The ZigBee Network in this study consists of two wearable devices, two routers, and one coordinator.},

This paper aims to identify factors associated with the type of care (informal, formal, mixed or no care at all) received by the French disabled elderly and to assess the care's relative costs. METHODS: This paper uses data from a French survey on disability; the 3,500 respondents of interest lived at home, were aged 60 and over, had severe disability and needed help with activities of daily living. We use a multinomial probit model to determine factors associated with type of care. We also assess the cost of care with the help of the proxy good method. RESULTS: One-third of disabled elderly people receive no care. Among those who are helped, 55{\%} receive informal, 25{\%} formal, and 20{\%} mixed care. Low socioeconomic status increases difficulties in accessing formal care. The estimated economic value of informal care is 6.6 billion euro [95{\%} CI = 5.9-7.2] and represents about two-thirds of the total cost of care. CONCLUSION: Public policies should pay more attention to inequalities in access to community care. They also should better support informal care, through respite care or workplace accommodations (working hours rescheduling or reduction for instance) not detrimental for the career of working caregivers.},

Today, the family structure has completely changed. Families are split apart, sometimes in the same city, sometimes in the same nation, but more often than before in different nations due to recent globalization. More people live alone or in small family structures which is a challenge for the social network. In addition, people live a longer life, part of it with possible disabilities [1, 2]. Specific Assistive Technology Information centers could be an answer to the needs of frail elderly persons living alone in their homes, but it is only part of the equation: technology works out well if it is combined with an individuals' strong motivation to use it, and of course, individuals must be able to afford it [3] (Fig. 14.1).},

Individual comments about specific problems were coded along the dimensions of (a) the locus of the problem (motor, visual, auditory, cognitive, external, or health limitations); (b) the activity involved (e.g., transportation, leisure, housekeeping); (c) whether the problem was attributable to task difficulty or the perception of risk; and (d) response to limitations (perseverance, cessation, compensation, or self-improvement). The data provide information about the types of difficulties encountered in everyday activities as well as the way in which individuals respond to such difficulties. Each comment was also coded in terms of whether it was remediable via training, design changes, or some combination of the two. More than half of the problems that were reported had the potential to be improved in some way, thus providing direction for future research in human factors and aging. Actual or potential applications of this research include identifying problems and difficulties that older adults encounter in daily activities such as transportation and leisure; more specifically, determining the degree to which such problems are potentially remediable by human factors solutions.

abstract = {The goal of this study is to improve future physical human-robot interaction and rehabilitation systems. Experiments were conducted to collect dominant hand grip pressure and joint-angle data during activities of daily life. Representative actions chosen as part of this study were: pushing a weighted cylinder along a flat surface, pulling a weighted cylinder across a flat surface, and lifting a weighted cylinder from a flat surface to shoulder height. Three separate weighted cylinders were used, 3lbs., 5lbs., and 10lbs., and the representative motions were repeated five times for each cylinder. A Tekscan Grip VersaTek Pressure Measurement System and Motion Analysis Cortex System were utilized to collect data. Each subject was outfitted with 18 separate sensorized piezo-resistive tiles placed on their dominant hand and 33 reflective markers at representative locations on their body. The motion of each cylinder was tracked via the placement of seven retro-reflective markers on the cylinder's surface. Analysis of cohort data from five male and five female volunteers, aged between 23 and 51 years, is presented. A Moving Average Filter was implemented to automatically determine contact between the subject's hand and the weighted cylinder. Once contact was determined during an action cycle, maximum detected pressure from each of 18 sensing areas was found. Results report wrist angle during the action- cycle as well as maximum applied pressure during each action across the cohort. Average wrist angle per action-cycle, by action, is also reported for the cohort. These data, along with results from a previous study, will be used improve and verify human intent models for use in future pHRI and rehabilitation systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel method for human activity recognition that benefits from the structure and sequential properties of the test data as well as the training data. In the training phase, we obtain a fraction of data labels at constant time intervals and use them in a semi-supervised graph-based method for recognizing the user's activities. We use label propagation on a k-nearest neighbor graph to calculate the probability of association of the unlabeled data to each class in this phase. Then we use these probabilities to train an HMM in a way that each of its hidden states corresponds to one class of activity. These probabilities are used to learn the transition probabilities between hidden states of the HMM which is used to predict the classes of the test data. Experimental results shows that the proposed method consistently outperforms the existing state of the art semi-supervised methods. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {The recognition of human activity is a challenging topic for machine learning. We present an analysis of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) in their ability to accurately classify Kinect kinematic activities. Twenty participants were captured using the Microsoft Kinect performing ten physical rehabilitation activities. We extracted the kinematic location, velocity and energy of the skeletal joints at each frame of the activity to form a feature vector. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was applied as a pre-processing step to reduce dimensionality and identify significant features amongst activity classes. SVM and RF are then trained on the PCA feature space to assess classification performance; we undertook an incremental increase in the dataset size.We analyse the classification accuracy, model training and classification time quantitatively at each incremental increase. The experimental results demonstrate that RF outperformed SVM in classification rate for six out of the ten activities. Although SVM has performance advantages in training time, RF would be more suited to real-time activity classification due to its low classification time and high classification accuracy when using eight to ten participants in the training set.},

When these sensors are attached to the subject's body, they permit continu- ous monitoring of numerous physiological signals. This has appealing use in healthcare applications, e.g. the exploitation of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) in daily activity monitoring for elderly people. In this paper, we present a system for human physical Activity Recognition (AR) using smartphone inertial sensors. As these mobile phones are limited in terms of energy and computing power, we propose a novel hardware-friendly approach for multiclass classification. This method adapts the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) and exploits fixed-point arithmetic for computational cost reduction. A comparison with the traditional SVM shows a significant improvement in terms of computational costs while maintaining similar accuracy, which can contribute to develop more sus- tainable systems for AmI.},

abstract = {With the advent of miniaturized sensing technology, which can be body-worn, it is now possible to collect and store data on different aspects of human activities under the conditions of free living. This technology has the potential to be used in automated activity profiling systems which produce a continuous record of bodily activity patterns over extended periods of time. Such activity pro- filing systems are dependent on recognition algorithms which can effectively interpret body-worn sensor data and identify different activities. The automated recognition of bodily activities using body-worn accelerometer data is a chal- lenging area of work. Existing activity recognition systems suffer from several obvious practical limitations such as the number, location and nature of sensors that people will tolerate. Other issues include ease of use, discretion, cost, and the ability to perform daily activities unimpeded. Variations can result in the sensors output for the same activity across different subjects and for the same individual. Errors can also arise due to variability in sensor signals caused by differences in sensor positioning and from environmental factors such as sensor temperature sensitivity and very little work has been done to validate the idea under the unsupervised real-world circumstances. This dissertation presents an accurate and robust tri-axial accelerometer-based bodily activity recognition framework. The novelty of the system compared to the previous accelerometer-based bodily activity recognition systems lies in: 1) Unlike previous systems, this system employs a better mathematical model, developed using using stochastic time series analysis, to describe ac- tivity acceleration-data. It is shown that such a model is more appropriate as it fits the data well and can be computed in real-time. (2) The system uses a novel state-activity based classification scheme that employs the proposed model for recognizing a diverse set of physical activities with a high accuracy. This scheme is capable of distinguishing the activities for which the previous systems showed difficulty, such as sitting and standing, with a good accuracy. (3) The system also implements a multi-stage classification scheme that employs the proposed model for accelerome- ters positions and attachment free activity recognition, offering better convenience for long-term recognition in free-living conditions. It allows users to carry the sensor in any pocket without attaching it firmly to any body part. 4) Finally, the system also implements a light-weight clas- sification scheme that uses the proposed model for recognizing activities in real-time using an accelerometer equipped smartphone independent of phones position on the human body. It is be- lieved that such technology will turn future smartphones into really clever handsets which would be capable of understanding what people are doing at any moment of time, anticipating what they would do next, and providing services automatically and accordingly.},

Thanks to the favorable propagation characteristics of the low frequency spectra, 802.11ah can provide much improved transmission range compared with the conventional 802.11 WLANs operating at 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. 802.11ah can be used for various purposes including large scale sensor networks, extended range hotspot, and outdoor Wi-Fi for cellular traffic offloading, whereas the available bandwidth is relatively narrow. In this paper, we give a technical overview of 802.11ah Physical (PHY) layer and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. For the 802.11ah PHY, which is designed based on the down-clocked operation of IEEE 802.11ac's PHY layer, we describe its channelization and transmission modes. Besides, 802.11ah MAC layer has adopted some enhancements to fulfill the expected system requirements. These enhancements include the improvement of power saving features, support of large number of stations, efficient medium access mechanisms and throughput enhancements by greater compactness of various frame formats. Through the numerical analysis, we evaluate the transmission range for indoor and outdoor environments and the theoretical throughput with newly defined channel access mechanisms.},

These heterogeneous systems are developed in isolation and consist of different operating systems, different programming platform and different tier of services. There is need for a mechanism that could make the heterogeneous systems `talk¿ each other and interoperate in an efficient manner regardless of operating platform.

abstract = {Recent work shows how to use local spatio-temporal features to learn models of realistic human actions from video. However, existing methods typically rely on a predefined spatial binning of the local descriptors to impose spatial information beyond a pure {\&}{\#}x201C;bag-of-words{\&}{\#}x201D; model, and thus may fail to capture the most informative space-time relationships. We propose to learn the shapes of space-time feature neighborhoods that are most discriminative for a given action category. Given a set of training videos, our method first extracts local motion and appearance features, quantizes them to a visual vocabulary, and then forms candidate neighborhoods consisting of the words associated with nearby points and their orientation with respect to the central interest point. Rather than dictate a particular scaling of the spatial and temporal dimensions to determine which points are near, we show how to learn the class-specific distance functions that form the most informative configurations. Descriptors for these variable-sized neighborhoods are then recursively mapped to higher-level vocabularies, producing a hierarchy of space-time configurations at successively broader scales. Our approach yields state-of-the-art performance on the UCF Sports and KTH datasets.},

abstract = {We describe a Bayesian approach for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of prior knowledge and statistical data. First and foremost, we develop a methodology for assessing informative priors needed for learning. Our approach is derived from a set of assumptions made previously as weil as the assumption of likelihood equivalence, which says that data should not help to discriminate network stmctures that represent the same assertions of conditional independence. We show that likelihood equivalence when combined with previously made assumptions implies that the nser's priors for network parameters can be encoded in a single Bayesian network for the next case to be seen--a prior network and a single measure of confidence for that network. Second, using these priors, we show how to compute the relative posterior probabilities of network structures given data. Third, we describe search methods for identifying network structures with high posterior probabilities. We describe polynomial algorithms for finding the highest-scoring network stmctures in the special case where every node has at most k = 1 parent. For the general case (k {\textgreater} 1), which is Np-hard, we review heuristic search algorithms including local search, iterative local search, and simulated annealing. Finally, we describe a methodology for evaluating Bayesian-network learning algorithms, and apply this approach to a comparison of various approaches.},

In this work we used acceleration data from a wristwatch in order to identify long-term activities. We compare the use of Hidden Markov Models and Conditional Random Fields for the segmentation task. We also added prior knowledge into the models regarding the duration of the activities by coding them as constraints and sequence patterns were added in the form of feature functions. We also performed subclassing in order to deal with the problem of intra-class fragmentation, which arises when the same label is applied to activities that are conceptually the same but very different from the acceleration point of view.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition and behavior monitoring in a home setting using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) provide a great potential for ambient assisted living (AAL) applications, ranging from health and wellbeing monitoring to resource consumption monitoring. However, due to the limitations of the sensor devices, challenges in wireless communication and the challenges in processing large amounts of sensor data in order to recognize complex human activities, WSN-based AAL systems are not effectively integrated in the home environment. Additionally, given the variety of sensor types and activities, selecting the most suitable set of sensors in the deployment is an important task. In order to investigate and propose solutions to such challenges, we introduce a WSN-based multimodal AAL system compatible for homes with multiple residents. Particularly, we focus on the details of the system architecture, including the challenges of sensor selection, deployment, networking and data collection and provide guidelines for the design and deployment of an effective AAL system. We also present the details of the field study we conducted, using the systems deployed in two different real home environments with multiple residents. With these systems, we are able to collect ambient sensor data from multiple homes. This data can be used to assess the wellbeing of the residents and identify deviations from everyday routines, which may be indicators of health problems. Finally, in order to elaborate on the possible applications of the proposed AAL system and to exemplify directions for processing the collected data, we provide the results of several human activity inference experiments, along with examples on how such results could be interpreted. We believe that the experiences shared in this work will contribute towards accelerating the acceptance of WSN-based AAL systems in the home setting.},

abstract = {Smart home platforms show promising outcomes to provide a better quality of life for residents in their homes. One of the main challenges that exists with these platforms in multi-residential houses is activity labeling. As most of the activity sensors do not provide any information regarding the identity of the person who triggers them, it is difficult to label the sensor events in multi-residential smart homes. To deal with this challenge, individual localization in different areas can be a promising solution. The localization information can be used to automatically label the activity sensor data to individuals. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is a promising technology for this application due to how easy it is to implement and its low energy footprint. In this approach, individuals wear a tag that broadcasts its unique identity (ID) in certain time intervals, while fixed scanners listen to the broadcasting packet to localize the tag and the individual. However, the localization accuracy of this method depends greatly on different settings of broadcasting signal strength, and the time interval of BLE tags. To achieve the best localization accuracy, this paper studies the impacts of different advertising time intervals and power levels, and proposes an efficient and applicable algorithm to select optimal value settings of BLE sensors. Moreover, it proposes an automatic activity labeling method, through integrating BLE localization information and ambient sensor data. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed structure is also demonstrated in a real multi-resident smart home scenario.},

abstract = {Naturalistic actions are everyday tasks (e.g. cooking) that require one to use multiple objects and sequence steps to achieve a goal. Naturalistic action impairment has been attributed to executive dysfunction [Higher cortical functions in man. New York: Basic Books, 1966], semantic knowledge degradation [Brain 111 (1988) 1173], and, more recently, general limitations in cognitive resources [Neuropsychology 12 (1998) 13]. Action impairments were explored in 51 dementia participants with the short form of the multi-level action test (MLAT-S). A clinical neuropsychological test protocol was also administered. Regression analyses including measures of executive functioning, semantic knowledge, and global cognitive functioning showed that global cognitive functioning was the best predictor of MLAT-S errors. Furthermore, task demands significantly influenced the type and frequency of errors, and dementia participants showed a pattern of errors similar to that reported in other clinical populations [Cognitive Neuropsychology 15 (1998) 617; Neuropsychologia 37 (1999) 51; Neuropsychology 12 (1998) 13]. Taken together, the present findings are inconsistent with semantic and executive accounts, but support the limited-capacity resource theory of naturalistic action impairment.

abstract = {This article describes an investigation to determine the optimal placement of accelerometers for the purpose of detecting a range of everyday activities. The paper investigates the effect of combining data from accelerometers placed at various bodily locations on the accuracy of activity detection. Eight healthy males participated within the study. Data were collected from six wireless tri-axial accelerometers placed at the chest, wrist, lower back, hip, thigh and foot. Activities included walking, running on a motorized treadmill, sitting, lying, standing and walking up and down stairs. The Support Vector Machine provided the most accurate detection of activities of all the machine learning algorithms investigated. Although data from all locations provided similar levels of accuracy, the hip was the best single location to record data for activity detection using a Support Vector Machine, providing small but significantly better accuracy than the other investigated locations. Increasing the number of sensing locations from one to two or more statistically increased the accuracy of classification. There was no significant difference in accuracy when using two or more sensors. It was noted, however, that the difference in activity detection using single or multiple accelerometers may be more pronounced when trying to detect finer grain activities. Future work shall therefore investigate the effects of accelerometer placement on a larger range of these activities.},

This paper describes the main features of BLE, explores its potential applications, and investigates the impact of various critical parameters on its performance. BLE represents a trade-off between energy consumption, latency, piconet size, and throughput that mainly depends on parameters such as connInterval and connSlaveLatency. According to theoretical results, the lifetime of a BLE device powered by a coin cell battery ranges between 2.0 days and 14.1 years. The number of simultaneous slaves per master ranges between 2 and 5,917. The minimum latency for a master to obtain a sensor reading is 676 µs, although simulation results show that, under high bit error rate, average latency increases by up to three orders of magnitude. The paper provides experimental results that complement the theoretical and simulation findings, and indicates implementation constraints that may reduce BLE performance.},

In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

Many agree that the current technologies are sufficient to achieve this vision, but that major breakthroughs are needed on the software side (activity recognition, security, context awareness, oppor-tunistic network, etc.). In fact, it is the key component for enabling sensors and effectors to provide valuable services. Consequently, it is important for researchers to prototype and experiment on new algorithms and models in realistic setting (e.g. smart home). In order to face this challenge, many research teams have to build new experimental infrastructures without any background experience, guidance or even a real idea of their research needs and issues. Our team is composed of specialists in AI for cognitive assis-tance and has worked with four major smart home infrastructures. From that experience, we propose, in this chapter, a set of guidelines for design-ing and implementing an efficient smart home architecture on both hard-ware and software perspective. While it focuses on the particular context of cognitive assistance, this chapter provides insightful information about con-struction choice of smart homes in general. This chapter aims to be a step toward the development of algorithms (rapid prototyping) and smart homes research. Moreover, we share our recent experience with the construction of a new smart home and clinical trials conducted at our laboratory with real Alzheimer's subjects.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of communication devices such as smartphones has led to the emergence of context-aware services that are able to respond to specific user activities or contexts. These services allow communication providers to develop new, added-value services for a wide range of applications such as social networking, elderly care and near-emergency early warning systems. At the core of these services is the ability to detect specific physical settings or the context a user is in, using either internal or external sensors. For example, using built-in accelerometers, it is possible to determine whether a user is walking or running at a specific time of day. By correlating this knowledge with GPS data, it is possible to provide specific information services to users with similar daily routines. This article presents a survey of the techniques for extracting this activity information from raw accelerometer data. The techniques that can be implemented in mobile devices range from classical signal processing techniques such as FFT to contemporary string-based methods. We present experimental results to compare and evaluate the accuracy of the various techniques using real data sets collected from daily activities.},

In a study of 10 participants performing 14 activities in a model apartment, our approach yielded recognition rates with pre- cision and recall both in the 90{\%} range. This compares well to recognition with a more intrusive short-range RFID bracelet that detects objects in the proximity of the user; this approach saw roughly 95{\%} precision and 60{\%} recall in the same study.

In addition, tolerance of the system for rejection of unsolicited gestures during the body movement was evaluated, and the two methods were implemented to ensure this; one based on an SVM threshold and another one based on the addition of a locking gesture. The resulting system is able to recognize up to 5 gestures (hand closing, hand opening, wrist flexion, wrist extension and double wrist flexion), presenting a classification accuracy of between 95{\%} and 100{\%} for a trained user and robustness against different body movements, guaranteed with the locking feature.

abstract = {There have been significant advances in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) recently. At the same time there exists an ever-growing demand for ubiquitous healthcare systems to improve human health and well-being. In most of IoT-based patient monitoring systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, there exists a bridging point (i.e., gateway) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., proposing thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, a Smart e-Health Gateway can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways enables massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a case study of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UTGATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system energy efficiency, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the ability of users to self-install a smart home in a box (SHiB) intended for use by a senior population. SHiB is a ubiquitous system, developed by the Washington State University Center for Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems (CASAS). Participants involved in this study are from the greater Palouse region of Washington State, and there are 13 participants in the study with an average age of 69.23. The SHiB package, which included several different types of components to collect and transmit sensor data, was given to participants to self-install. After installation of the SHiB, the participants were visited by researchers for a check of the installation. The researchers evaluated how well the sensors were installed and asked the resident questions about the installation process to help improve the SHiB design. The results indicate strengths and weaknesses of the SHiB design. Indoor motion tracking sensors are installed with high success rate, low installation success rate was found for door sensors and setting up the Internet server.},

abstract = {The macroalga Fucus vesiculosus carries a specific community of surface bacteria. To identify chemical compounds that possibly mediate abundance and community composition of algae-associated bacteria, we tested the effect of surface-available algal compounds on bacterial settlement and community composition under field conditions. Compounds on algal thalli were separated from the surface by extraction with organic solvents and investigated on growth inhibition and settlement of bacterial isolates. Based on in vitro data, partially purified extract fractions were then exposed to bacterial colonizers in vivo followed by bacterial enumeration and community analysis. The polar fraction of the algal surface extract revealed a significant profouling effect for Vibrionales, whereas the nonpolar fraction - containing the xanthophyll pigment fucoxanthin and other unidentified nonpolar surface compounds - revealed a significant 80{\%} reduction of surface colonizing bacteria. The analysis of bacterial surface communities by 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated that the antifouling activity of nonpolar algal surface compounds was targeting the abundance of natural bacterial colonizers rather than the relative composition of bacterial members within the community. Moreover, the bacterial community composition on F. vesiculosus was markedly different from artificial control substrates and chemically manipulated experimental treatments, suggesting that other, nonextractable surface features and/or physical properties render algal-specific epiphytic bacterial communities.},

Over 1.6 million U.S. adults are treated for fall-related injuries in emergency rooms every year suffering fractures, loss of independence, and even death. It is clear then, that this problem must be addressed in a prompt manner, and the use of pervasive computing plays a key role to achieve this. Fall detection (FD) and fall prevention (FP) are research areas that have been active for over a decade, and they both strive for improving people's lives through the use of pervasive computing. This paper surveys the state of the art in FD and FP systems, including qualitative comparisons among various studies. It aims to serve as a point of reference for future research on the mentioned systems. A general description of FD and FP systems is provided, including the different types of sensors used in both approaches. Challenges and current solutions are presented and described in great detail. A 3-level taxonomy associated with the risk factors of a fall is proposed. Finally, cutting edge FD and FP systems are thoroughly reviewed and qualitatively compared, in terms of design issues and other parameters.},

It is a high quality dataset collected in a smart apartment with a dense but non intrusive sensor infrastructure. Second, we present the experience of using temporal logic and model checking for activity recognition. Temporal logic allows specifying activities as complex events of object usage which can be described at different granularity. It also expresses temporal ordering between events thus palliating a limitation of ontology based activity recognition. The results on using the CADP toolbox for activity recognition in the real life collected data are very good.},

@article{UNFPA2007,
abstract = {In 2008, for the first time, more than half of the worlds population will be living in urban areas. By 2030, towns and cities will be home to almost 5 billion people. The urban population of Africa and Asia will double in less than a generation. This unprecedented shift could enhance development and promote sustainabilityor it could deepen poverty and accelerate environmental degradation. The 2007 State of World Population report outlines the challenges and opportunities presented by the coming, inevitable urban growth. It also dispels many misconceptions about urbanization and calls on policymakers to take concerted, proactive steps to harness the potential of cities to improve the lives of all. Peering into the Dawn of an Urban Millennium In 2008, the world reaches an invisible but momentous milestone: For the first time in history, more than half its human population, 3.3 billion people, will be living in urban areas. By 2030, this is expected to swell to almost 5 billion. Many of the new urbanites will be poor. Their future, the future of cities in developing countries, the future of humanity itself, all depend very much on decisions made now in preparation for this growth. While the worlds urban population grew very rapidly (from 220 million to 2.8 billion) over the 20th century, the next few decades will see an unprecedented scale of urban growth in the developing world. This will be particularly notable in Africa and Asia where the urban population will double between 2000 and 2030: That is, the accumulated urban growth of these two regions during the whole span of history will be duplicated in a single generation. By 2030, the towns and cities of the developing world will make up 81 per cent of urban humanity. Urbanizationthe increase in the urban share of total populationis inevitable, but it can also be positive. The current concentration of poverty, slum growth and social disruption in cities does paint a threatening picture: Yet no country in the industrial age has ever achieved significant economic growth without urbanization. Cities concentrate poverty, but they also represent the best hope of escaping it. Cities also embody the environmental damage done by modern civilization; yet experts and policymakers increasingly recognize the potential value of cities to long-term sustainability. If cities create environmental problems, they also contain the solutions. The potential benefits of urbanization far outweigh the disadvantages: The challenge is in learning how to exploit its possibilities. In 1994, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development called on governments to respond to the need of all citizens, including urban squatters, for personal safety, basic infrastructure and services, to eliminate health and social problems . . . .(1) More recently, the United Nations Millennium Declaration drew attention to the growing significance of urban poverty, specifying, in Target 11, the modest ambition of achieving by 2020 a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers.(2) UN-Habitats Third World Urban Forum, as well as its State of the Worlds Cities 2006/7, successfully focused world interest on the deteriorating social and environmental conditions of urban localities.(3) The process of globalization has also drawn attention to the productive potential of cities and to the human cost. Yet the enormous scale and impact of future urbanization have not penetrated the publics mind. So far, attention has centred mostly on immediate concerns, problems such as how to accommodate the poor and improve living conditions; how to generate employment; how to reduce cities ecological footprint; how to improve governance; and how to administer increasingly complex urban systems. These are all obviously important questions, but they shrink in comparison with the problems raised by the impending future growth of the urban population. Up to now, policymakers and civil society organizations have reacted to challenges as they arise. This is no longer enough. A pre-emptive approach is needed if urbanization in developing countries is to help solve social and environmental problems, rather than make them catastrophically worse. The present Report thus attempts to look beyond current problems, real, urgent and poignant though they are. Yet, it is also a call to action. The Report tries to grasp the implications of the imminent doubling of the developing worlds urban population and discusses what needs to be done to prepare for this massive increase. It looks more closely at the demographic processes underlying urban growth in developing areas and their policy implications. It specifically examines the consequences of the urban transition for poverty reduction and sustainability. It surveys the differing conditions and needs of poor urban women and men, and the obstacles they face as they strive to claim their rights and realize their potential as productive members of the new urban world. Although mega-cities have received most of the attention, conditions in smaller urban areas call for even greater consideration. Contrary to general belief, the bulk of urban population growth is likely to be in smaller cities and towns, whose capabilities for planning and implementation can be exceedingly weak. Yet the worldwide process of decentralizing governmental powers is heaping greater responsibility on them. As the population of smaller cities increases, their thin managerial and planning capacities come under mounting stress. New ways will have to be found to equip them to plan ahead for expansion, to use their resources sustainably and to deliver essential services. One of the Reports key observations is that poor people will make up a large part of future urban growth. This simple fact has generally been overlooked, at great cost. Most urban growth now stems from natural increase (more births than deaths) rather than migration. But wherever it comes from, the growth of urban areas includes huge numbers of poor people. Ignoring this basic reality will make it impossible either to plan for inevitable and massive city growth or to use urban dynamics to help relieve poverty. Once policymakers and civil society understand and accept the demographic and social composition of urban growth, some basic approaches and initiatives suggest themselves. These could have a huge impact on the fate of poor people and on the viability of the cities themselves. Throughout this Report the message is clear: Urban and national governments, together with civil society, and supported by international organizations, can take steps now that will make a huge difference for the social, economic and environmental living conditions of a majority of the worlds population. Three policy initiatives stand out in this connection. First, preparing for an urban future requires, at a minimum, respecting the rights of the poor to the city. As Chapter 3 shows, many policymakers continue to try to prevent urban growth by discouraging rural-urban migration, with tactics such as evicting squatters and denying them services. These attempts to prevent migration are futile, counter-productive and, above all, wrong, a violation of peoples rights. If policymakers find urban growth rates too high, they have effective options which also respect human rights. Advances in social development, such as promoting gender equity and equality, making education universally available and meeting reproductive health needs, are important for their own sake. But they will also enable women to avoid unwanted fertility and reduce the main factor in the growth of urban populationsnatural increase. Secondly, cities need a longer-term and broader vision of the use of urban space to reduce poverty and promote sustainability. This includes an explicit concern with the land needs of the poor. For poor families, having an adequate piece of landwith access to water, sewage, power and transporton which they can construct their homes and improve their lives is essential: Providing it requires a new and proactive approach. Planning for such spatial and infrastructure requirements, keeping in mind poor womens multiple roles and needs, will greatly improve the welfare of poor families. This kind of people-centred development knits together the social fabric and encourages economic growth that includes the poor. Similarly, protecting the environment and managing ecosystem services in future urban expansion requires purposeful management of space in advance of needs. The urban footprint stretches far beyond city boundaries. Cities influence, and are affected by, broader environmental considerations. Proactive policies for sustainability will also be important in view of climate change and the considerable proportion of urban concentrations at or near sea level. Thirdly, population institutions and specialists can and should play a key role in supporting community organizations, social movements, governments and the international community in improving the nature and form of future urban expansion, and thus enhancing its power to reduce poverty and promote environmental sustainability. A concerted international effort at this critical time is crucial to clarify policy options and provide information and analyses that will support strategies to improve our urban future.},

NFC-equipped phone (NFC phone) that embed the NFC technology into cellular phone earns increasingly attention in business, such as payment and ticketing. This paper presents a novel architecture for NFC phone driven context-aware smart spaces. Based on the architecture, users can take a NFC phone that carry predefined personal desire to control devices, such as home appliances. The appliances can be controlled and driven by the request sent from a NFC phone without considering the context of the environment by using predefined ontology and rule-based reasoning. We also implemented a prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture and evaluate the performance to show the efficiency.},

abstract = {Background Our daily activities imply displacements on various types of soil. For persons with gait disorder or losing functional autonomy, walking on some types of soil could be challenging because of the risk of falling it represents. Methods In this paper, we present, in a first part, the use of an enactive shoe for an automatic differentiation of several types of soil. In a second part, using a second improved prototype (an enactive insole), twelve participants with Parkinson's disease (PD) and nine age-matched controls have performed the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test on six types of soil with and without cueing. The frequency of the cueing was set at 10{\%} above the cadence computed at the lower risk of falling (walking over the concrete). Depending on the cadence computed at the lower risk, the enactive insole activates a vibrotactile cueing aiming to improve gait and balance control. Finally, a risk index is computed using gait parameters in relation to given type of soil. Results The frequency analysis of the heel strike vibration allows the differentiation of various types of soil. The risk computed is associated to an appropriate rhythmic cueing in order to improve balance and gait impairment. The results show that a vibrotactile cueing could help to reduce the risk of falling. Conclusions Firstly, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the risk of falling while walking on different types of soil using vibrotactile cueing. We found a significant difference and a significant decrease in the computed risks of falling for most of types of soil especially for deformable soils which can lead to fall. Secondly, heel strike provides an approximation of the impulse response of the soil that can be analyzed with time and frequency-domain modeling. From these analyses, an index is computed enabling differentiation the types of soil.},

abstract = {Nowadays, there are many technologies that support location systems involving intrusive and nonintrusive equipment and also varying in terms of precision, range, and cost. However, the developers some time neglect the noise introduced by these systems, which prevents these systems from reaching their full potential. Focused on this problem, in this research work a comparison study between three different filters was performed in order to reduce the noise introduced by a location system based on RFID UWB technology with an associated error of approximately 18 cm. To achieve this goal, a set of experiments was devised and executed using a miniature train moving at constant velocity in a scenario with two distinct shapes-linear and oval. Also, this train was equipped with a varying number of active tags. The obtained results proved that the Kalman Filter achieved better results when compared to the other two filters. Also, this filter increases the performance of the location system by 15{\%} and 12{\%} for the linear and oval paths respectively, when using one tag. For a multiple tags and oval shape similar results were obtained (11-13{\%} of improvement).},

While useful in many laboratory settings, many of these physiological sensors (e.g., fMRI, EEG, EKG, etc.) are impractical and severely limited in other scenarios due to (1) prohibitive cost, (2) small sample size, (3) invasiveness, and (4) the difficulty to match psychological traits to physiological measures. In this study, we demonstrate how inexpensive consumer-grade wearable technologies overcome these first three limitations while we extend existing research on exploring the fourth limitation.},

The healthcare system is going through a transformation in which continuous monitoring of inhabitants is possible even without hospitalization. The advancement of sensing technologies, embedded systems, wireless communication technologies, nano technologies, and miniaturization makes it possible to develop smart systems to monitor activities of human beings continuously. Wearable sensors detect abnormal and/or unforeseen situations by monitoring physiological parameters along with other symptoms. Therefore, necessary help can be provided in times of dire need. This paper reviews the latest reported systems on activity monitoring of humans based on wearable sensors and issues to be addressed to tackle the challenges.

abstract = {Signal segmentation is a crucial stage in the activity recognition process; however, this has been rarely and vaguely characterized so far. Windowing approaches are normally used for segmentation, but no clear consensus exists on which window size should be preferably employed. In fact, most designs normally rely on figures used in previous works, but with no strict studies that support them. Intuitively, decreasing the window size allows for a faster activity detection, as well as reduced resources and energy needs. On the contrary, large data windows are normally considered for the recognition of complex activities. In this work, we present an extensive study to fairly characterize the windowing procedure, to determine its impact within the activity recognition process and to help clarify some of the habitual assumptions made during the recognition system design. To that end, some of the most widely used activity recognition procedures are evaluated for a wide range of window sizes and activities. From the evaluation, the interval 1-2 s proves to provide the best trade-off between recognition speed and accuracy. The study, specifically intended for on-body activity recognition systems, further provides designers with a set of guidelines devised to facilitate the system definition and configuration according to the particular application requirements and target activities.},

abstract = {About the report The World Alzheimer Report 2016 reviews research evidence on the elements of healthcare for people living with dementia and suggests how it should be improved and made more efficient. People living with dementia have poor access to appropriate healthcare, even in most high income country settings, where only around 50{\%} of people living with dementia receive a diagnosis. In low and middle income countries, less than 10{\%} of cases are diagnosed. As populations age, due to increasing life expectancy, the number of people with dementia is increasing. We estimate that there were 46.8 million people worldwide living with dementia in 2015 and this number will reach 131.5 million in 2050. It is unlikely that the usual specialist-led approach to dementia care can expand fast enough to keep up with increases in need, and even more unlikely that healthcare coverage can be improved without rebalancing to give primary care a more prominent role.},
